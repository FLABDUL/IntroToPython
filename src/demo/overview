# Overview of Python

## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Python is widely used in various fields such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence,
scientific computing, and more.

## Python Timeline

- **1989**: Python was conceived by Guido van Rossum.
- **1991**: Python 1.0 was released.
- **2000**: Python 2.0 was released with new features, including list comprehensions.
- **2008**: Python 3.0 was released, which was not backward compatible with Python 2.
- **2020**: Python 2 reached the end of its life (January 1, 2020).
- **2021**: Python 3.9 and 3.10 were released, featuring several new capabilities and optimizations.

## Advantages of Python

1. Easy to read and write, making it great for beginners.
2. Extensive standard library and community-contributed libraries.
3. Strong community support and extensive documentation.
4. Versatile: can be used for web development, data science, automation, etc.
5. Cross-platform compatibility.

## Disadvantages of Python

1. Slower execution speed compared to compiled languages like C or C++.
2. Weak in mobile computing.
3. The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can be a limitation for multi-threading.
4. Some libraries may be less optimized for performance.
5. Python can consume more memory than other programming languages.

## Getting Help with pydoc

You can use `pydoc` to get help on Python modules, classes, and functions.
To access `pydoc`, you can use the command line:

- To view documentation for a specific module, run:
  pydoc <module_name>

- To start a local web server for browsing documentation, run:
  pydoc -b

- To get help on a specific function or class, run:
  pydoc <module_name>.<function_name>

For example:
  pydoc math.sqrt
